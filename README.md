Receipt Forecasting System
This project provides a time series forecasting solution for predicting receipt volumes in 2022 based on historical 2021 data. The system uses a custom LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network built from scratch in PyTorch and provides an interactive web dashboard for visualization.
Overview
The Receipt Forecasting System processes daily receipt count data from 2021, trains a deep learning model to identify patterns and trends, and generates predictions for each month of 2022. The dashboard allows for parameter tuning and real-time model retraining.
Requirements

Python 3.9+
PyTorch
Flask
NumPy, Pandas
Chart.js (included via CDN)
Font Awesome (included via CDN)

Getting Started
Option 1: Running Locally

Clone the repository
Copygit clone https://github.com/yourusername/receipt-forecasting.git
cd receipt-forecasting

Set up a virtual environment
Copy# Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install dependencies
Copypip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare the data

Place your 2021 receipt data in the data/ directory as receipts_2021.csv
The CSV should have columns for date and receipt counts


Run the application
Copypython app.py

Access the dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000



Option 2: Using Docker

Build the Docker image
Copydocker build -t receipt-forecaster .

Run the container
Copydocker run -p 5000:5000 receipt-forecaster

Access the dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000



Using the Dashboard

View Forecasts: The dashboard automatically displays monthly and daily receipt predictions for 2022.
Adjust Model Parameters:

Input Sequence Length: Number of historical days the model considers for each prediction (7-335 days)
Hidden Dimension: Size of the LSTM hidden state, affecting model complexity (16-256)
LSTM Layers: Number of stacked LSTM layers (1-4)


Retrain the Model: After adjusting parameters, click "Retrain Model" to regenerate forecasts with your new configuration.

Model Architecture
The forecasting system uses a custom LSTM neural network with the following components:

Input Features: Historical receipt counts, day of week, month information
Architecture: Multi-layer LSTM with configurable hidden dimensions
Training Method: Sliding window approach with mean squared error loss
Output: Daily predictions aggregated into monthly forecasts
